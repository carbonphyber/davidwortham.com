## Announcing This Website

[DavidWortham.com](https://davidwortham.com/) is rewritten and will be refreshed.

I have ended my work with Balbix, Inc. and will be persuing iOS / Mac OS X app development. Once I have more specifics about the company, I will update here and develop a website specifically for that company.

This website will serve as high level changes, and also some Software Engineering + DevOps articles.
